After the CGI program is installed and the initial database is created, you will need to make
some updates to your web environment.

1) The sqlite3 database is installed in /var/www/run.  When modifying the direction sqlite3 will
need to create temporary files in that director, so the director permissions will need to all
the web user to create files in that directory.

2) The mydyndns_cleanup.sh script should be run via cron on a semi regular basis.  The following
example will run the script once a day.

0 0 * * * /usr/local/bin/mydyndns_cleanup.sh -d /var/www/run/mydyndns.db -t 30

3) The mydyndns_gendns.sh script should be run on a regular interval to support updates.  The
following will run the script once an hour.

0 * * * * /usr/local/bin/mydyndns_gendns.sh -d /var/www/run/mydyndns.db -o dynamic.dns.zone.name > /path/to/the/zone/files.zone
1 * * * * /script/to/reload/dns_server
